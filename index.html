        <h2>Why Care About Layout?</h2>
        
        <p>When a reader looks at a piece of writing, the first thing they see isn&rsquo;t the writing. It&rsquo;s everything surrounding the writing.</p>
        
        <p>Look at the pictures below. Underneath each picture, write down what you think each piece is about. Don&rsquo;t even read the writing. Just trust your gut.</p>

        <p><br></p>

        <textarea type="text" name="Input 2" rows="5" cols="90" placeholder="Write what you think this piece is about here!"></textarea>

        
        <p>Now, go back and read the pieces. Take some time to reflect. How did the formatting influence your expectations? What elements do you think caused this?</p>
        
        <p>The layout - the font choice, colors, where the text is, what shape the text is in, the pictures - of a page has an impact on readers. </p>
        
        <p>You&rsquo;re here because you&rsquo;re a writer. If you want to have a maximal impact on your readers, you need to learn layout in order to reach your audience.</p>
        
        <p>Keep reading. I&rsquo;ll teach you everything I&rsquo;ve learned.</p>

        <h2>The Rhetoric of Layout</h2>
        <p>As a writer, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re familiar with the rhetorical triangle. I&rsquo;ll give you a refresher, though.</p>
        
        <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/845316077629603891/1239617771587895419/11932449495_8df65eb0c6_b.png?ex=66439383&is=66424203&hm=245be1144f03b5b249dab985ffdc0cf5aafb0b51928a60a291007add83db061a&" alt="The rhetorical triangle. ">
        <p>Source: Albert.io</p>
        
        <p>The rhetorical triangle has three parts: author, audience, purpose. The speaker is you, the person writing the text. The audience is the people reading the text. The purpose is what sort of impression you, the writer, want to leave on the audience. Together, they make up a message conveyed to the audience. When writing, you have to keep in mind these three elements in order to craft a compelling text.</p>
        
        <p>The rhetorical triangle also is important to layout. I&rsquo;m going to examine the three parts here:</p>
        
        <p><b>Author:</b> A doctor wouldn&rsquo;t write a memo in rainbow comic sans. Nor would a birthday clown make an advertisement in 12 point times new roman. The formatting choices you pick can help establish who you are and why the audience should listen to you.</p>
        
        <p><b>Audience:</b> When formatting, it&rsquo;s important to keep in mind who your audience is. If you&rsquo;re writing for an older audience, a larger font may be more appropriate. When writing for kids, bright colors and pictures will help you reach your audience. A piece of this is keeping in mind that people with accessibility needs may want to read your writing, which we&rsquo;ll talk about more in depth in the Accessibility section of this work.</p>
        
        <p><b>Purpose:</b> Thinking about what sort of impact you want to have on your audience can help you make layout decisions. If you want readers to remember a certain point, a big, bold font may help emphasize that piece of your argument. If you want your audience to understand you, graphs and schematics may be appropriate.</p>

        <h2>The Anatomy of Layout</h2>
        <p>Now you know why you need layout, and what to think about when making layout choices. Next, I&rsquo;m going to talk about what components designers think about when laying out text. </p>

        <p>Source: The Grid 101 by Clayton Notestein</p>
        
        <p>This is the grid. The grid is the heart of modular layout, the school of layout I will teach you today. These are the parts of the grid:</p>
        
        <p><br></p>

        <h3>Whitespace</h3>
        <img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1669c4df-e833-4833-a491-edd5fdadb4e0_821x501.webp">
        <p>Source: The Grid 101 by Clayton Notestein</p>

        <p>The most important part of a good layout is not text, but the absence of it.</p>
        
        <p>You want a good chunk of whitespace, at least an inch, around the outside of your text. This is called the margin. Having a wide enough margin makes your text readable.</p>
        
        <p>If you&rsquo;re planning to print your layout as a book, pay special attention to the margins where the spine will be. This is called the gutter, and it should be larger than your margins by at least half an inch so that your text is not eaten up by the book&rsquo;s binding.</p>
        
        <p><br></p>

        <h3>The Markers</h3>
        <img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0c6fd653-4bab-4e78-9bd9-d044d79ee14f_821x501.webp">
        <p>Source: The Grid 101 by Clayton Notestein</p>

        <p>Markers give information about the text - for example, chapter headers, and author names. Markers usually live in the margins. Keep the placement of them consistent and avoid redundancies.</p>
        
        <p><br></p>

        <h3>Columns, Flowlines, and Alleys</h3>
        <img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd97ef89c-7748-4994-9003-000515b46a64_821x501.webp">
        <p>Source: The Grid 101 by Clayton Notestein</p>

        <p>First of all - columns. Just like columns on a spreadsheet, these are vertical lines that split your page evenly. Start with a small number - even 1 is ok - and raise as you need it.</p>
        
        <p>Flowlines are the rows to your columns. Common wisdom is to start with no flowlines and add them as you need them. As you gain more skill, you can use flowlines to determine where you want text and images to fit together on the page.</p>
        
        <p>Alleys are mini-margins within your flowlines and columns. If you add an image, for example, you&rsquo;ll want an alley separating it from the text so everything&rsquo;s not squished together.</p>
        
        <p><br></p>

        <h3>Modules and Regions</h3>
        <img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6d6c06e8-c93e-44f5-b2fe-b219e122fa3e_821x501.webp">
        <p>Source: The Grid 101 by Clayton Notestein</p>
        <p>Modules are a chunk of something, whether it be a paragraph of text or an image. A region is a combination of modules that make up a page. Multiple regions combine together to form the final piece of layout.</p>
        
        <p>Now that you know the vocabulary to talk about layout, next we&rsquo;ll talk about what makes layout good.</p>

        <h2>The Aesthetics of Layout</h2>
        <p>Now that you know the basics, let&rsquo;s talk about layout as an art. I&rsquo;m going to be real with you - I&rsquo;m not a graphic designer. However, I&rsquo;ve read books by real graphic designers. Here&rsquo;s a very short introduction to the two core principles of design:</p>
        
        <h3>Emphasis</h3>
        <img height=100px src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/845316077629603891/1240067317442941048/industrial-security-1492046_1280.png?ex=6645362f&is=6643e4af&hm=7533b2dc63a41be68f76bafa274d373097cb56ca301fdeb36bbe0ccdc2920665&">
        <p>Source: David Rock Design</p>
        <p>What do you want to stand out? Titles, a quote, a core message? You can control the emphasis of your words by thinking about the following principles:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Contrast: words in bright, bold colors will stand out more than words with muted colors.</li>
            <li>Proportion: large words will stand out more than small words.</li>
            <li>Whitespace: words with a lot of space around them will stand out more than words that are closer to other words.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Movement</h3>
        <img height=100px src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/845316077629603891/1240068183453335703/runner-546896_1280.png?ex=664536fe&is=6643e57e&hm=04eeb4eacccdf26d76a03362747fd5a4878b81ecd76c4c5deb04752a1cd6a373&">
        <p>Source: MerchArts</p>
        <p>How is the reader going to move through the page page? How will you facilitate that? To make sure the reader moves through your text the way you intend them to, think about these principles:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Hierarchy: You can guide what order your readers will read words in by emphasizing the words you want them to read first.</li>
            <li>Rhythm: If two pieces of text are laid out in the same way, readers will experience them in the same way. You can help readers build a rhythm by repeating layout, or break a rhythm to emphasize a new idea.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How to Make Your Work Accessible</h2>
        <p>Try to read the text below.</p>

        

        <p>[Insert awful horrible text here]</p>

        <label for="dog-names">Font:</label> 
            <select name="dog-names" id="dog-names"> 
                <option value="Bad Font">Bad Font</option> 
                <option value="Ok Font">Ok Font</option> 
                <option value="Best Font">Best Font</option> 
            </select>
        
        <label for="dog-names">Font color:</label> 
        <select name="dog-names" id="dog-names"> 
            <option value="Bad Font">Bad Color</option> 
            <option value="Ok Font">Ok Color</option> 
            <option value="Best Font">Best Color</option> 
        </select>

        <label for="dog-names">Background color:</label> 
        <select name="dog-names" id="dog-names"> 
            <option value="Bad Background">Bad Background</option> 
            <option value="Okay Background">Okay Background</option> 
            <option value="Best Background">Best Background</option> 
        </select>

        <p>Now, choose new formatting options on the dropdown menus and try again. Mess around. See what works for you.</p>
        
        <p>This is an example of a basic layout principle: accessibility. Briefly put, if someone can&rsquo;t read your writing, they&rsquo;re not going to read your writing. That&rsquo;s bad.</p>
        
        <p>The basics of accessibility are easy: you should pick a font big enough for most people to read, in a color they can see clearly, with a consistent size and placement. However, if you want everyone to be able to read your writing, here&rsquo;s some things you may have not thought about before:</p>
        
        <p>People with visual disabilities will want to read your writing. To help people with visual disabilities:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Check that your colors contrast enough with <a data-fr-linked="true" href="https://www.tpgi.com/color-contrast-checker/">https://www.tpgi.com/color-contrast-checker/</a></li>
            <li>Check that your colors are legible to a colorblind person with <a data-fr-linked="true" href="https://davidmathlogic.com/colorblind/#%23D81B60-%231E88E5-%2307FF7C-%23004D40 ">https://davidmathlogic.com/colorblind/#%23D81B60-%231E88E5-%2307FF7C-%23004D40&amp;nbsp</a>;</li>
            <li>Avoid pure black on pure white text.</li>
            <li>Add ample space in-between text blocks.</li>
            <li>Choose a larger font size.</li>
            <li>Group text in about the same area so someone with a screen magnifier doesn&rsquo;t struggle to follow the flow of text.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Neurodivergent people are also an audience you should think about. Here&rsquo;s some ways you can help:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Choose a legible font.</li>
            <li>There&rsquo;s a good deal of scholarship on dyslexia friendly fonts - fonts made explicitly for dyslexic readers don&rsquo;t have evidence that they help. However, there is evidence that sans serif fonts like Arial and Courier help dyslexic readers.</li>
            <li>Try to avoid distractions that pull attention away from your text. Flashing images, too many bright colors, or videos on autoplay can cause strain and pull attention away from your text.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Images</h2>
        <p>They say an image is worth a thousand words. I&rsquo;m not sure if this is true, but a well-chosen image can definitely improve a piece of text.</p>
        
        <p>The grid is your best tool for deciding where to place an image - most images should fit within the grid. You can also put images under text, but make sure your text is still readable. Relating back to accessibility, if your program allows you, adding alternate text - text that describes an image - can help people experiencing your writing with a screen reader.</p>
        
        <p>You might have spent a lot of time honing your skill in the visual arts, but if you&rsquo;re like me, I&rsquo;m guessing you haven&rsquo;t. Therefore, you&rsquo;ll need to find images to use. Museum archives are a great source of public domain art and stock image sites like Pixabay are good for photos. You can use filters or draw on existing images to add your own touch.</p>
        
        <p>Make sure you have permission to use an image. If an image is in the public domain, it&rsquo;s fair game. Licenses like the Creative Commons License and the Fair Use License let you use an image, but sometimes with caveats. Make sure to read the license so you know how and under what circumstances you&rsquo;re allowed to use an image. Always give attribution to whoever created the image. If an image doesn&rsquo;t have a license, don&rsquo;t use it.</p>
        
        <p>Also: don&rsquo;t use generative AI for images. It steals art from artists without their consent to generate images. There&rsquo;s lots of good art you can use that isn&rsquo;t stolen from artists.</p>

        <h2>Go Try it Yourself!</h2>
        <p>If there&rsquo;s one idea I would like you to take away from this article, it&rsquo;s that you can do layout! It&rsquo;s a skill that takes practice, but I&rsquo;ve given you a good foundation to start practicing with. Go, experiment, try something new! Here&rsquo;s the software I&rsquo;ve found is best for beginners to layout:</p>
        
        <p>If you plan to share your work as a pdf or a printed work, Canva is a wonderful piece of layout software.</p>
        
        <p>Electric Zine Maker is a fun way to make short, printable booklets.</p>
        
        <p>If you want a website, Wix, Caard, and Neocities are all fun, simple ways to make and host websites.</p>
        
        <p>If you want to get really hands-on with making a website, you can download VSCode and start coding from scratch. You&rsquo;ll need the programming languages Html, CSS, and Javascript to make a website and W3Schools is my favorite website for learning how to write in those languages. Then, you can host a website for free on Github.</p>
        
        <p>Your writing is worth putting out in the world! Hopefully this article helps you frame your writing with confidence.</p>
